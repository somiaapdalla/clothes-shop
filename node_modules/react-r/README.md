# React-MVx

React-MVx is the MVVM SPA framework with React as View layer, built upon frontend technologies used at Volicon/Verizon for 3 years.

Contrary to the popular React approaches, React-MVx does not try to avoid the distributed mutable application state. Instead, it is focused on bringing stateful components capabilities to their maximum.

React-MVx manages both local UI state and application domain state with the same universal state container provided by [Type-R](https://github.com/Volicon/Type-R) data framework. It supports:

- two-way data binding
- declarative state validation
- nested data structures & observable changes
- painless state synchronization
- automatic JSON serialization

React-MVx application architecture follows scalable MVVM architecture pattern. It features the _unidirectional data flow_ and _pure render_ optimization. But contrary to the popular React state management solutions:

- It doesn't rely on singletons (unless you _really_ need some data to be shared across pages)
- It assists and encourages usage of _locally encapsulated state_ and _OO decomposition_.

## Examples

- [Checklist tree]()([source](/examples/checklistTree))
- [TodoMVC]()([source](/examples/todomvc))
- [UsersList]()([source](/examples/userslist))
- Flux Comparison([source](/examples/flux-comparison))
- Babel + Webpack [boilerplate]()([source](/examples/babel-boilerplate))

## Documentation

Start [there](https://volicon.github.io/React-MVx/Guides/Data_binding_and_forms.html).

More tutorials to come.

## Installation & Requirements

Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE10+.

Requires `react` and `type-r` as peer dependencies. Installation (assuming that React is installed):

    `npm install react-mvx type-r --save-dev`

The best way to start is to use the [boilerplate](/examples/babel-boilerplate) which already has
babel, webpack 2, and minimal set of required dependencies configured.

TypeScript is unsupported (yet) but may work.
